# Xmarin Crossplattform slider
I have started to write a crossplattform app with Xamarin for ios, windows and Android devices. I started using Xamarin a year ago. But did not get anywhere. I restarted now and decided to make a Hello world applikation in the form of a slider.

This slider can be used to give a level of much pain you have. IRL they are used by nurses and doctors when asking patients: Show us on this stick how much pain you have on a scale between 0 and 10.

Ill add more blogpost as I evovole. My goal is to make and publish a simple app on all three plattform with unit test and shared code. Also share problems with publishing them on all three app stores.
The important code is in the ViewController I decided to declare all GUI in code instead of xml or XAML. I wanted control over it and I did not get the XCode GUI drag and drop to work.
